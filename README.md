# Raffle Ticket Bot

## Overview

This repository contains a bot developed to continuously test for winning raffle tickets displayed during the purchase process on the website Rifei.com.br. The project was an interesting endeavor in the field of information security. Following the success of the program, I notified the website administrators of the vulnerability found, along with suggestions for enhanced protection.

## Motivation

The motivation behind creating this bot was to explore and understand potential security vulnerabilities in online platforms, particularly those related to raffle ticket purchases. By developing this bot, I aimed to contribute to improving the security measures of the Rifei.com.br website and similar platforms.

## Functionality

The bot operates by continuously monitoring the purchase process on Rifei.com.br for any instances where winning raffle tickets are displayed. Upon detecting such tickets, the bot can trigger actions as per the predefined instructions, such as alerting the user or logging the occurrence for further analysis.

## How to Use

To use the bot, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (puppeteer).
* As displayed, the bot will ask you for the raffle link, number of tickets to be bought, winningTickets and your cellphone number.
* Run the bot script and monitor its output for any detected winning raffle tickets.
